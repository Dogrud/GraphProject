A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. The messages will be "unwrapped" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. The spruce has an antenna which can receive Bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the Tate. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.
