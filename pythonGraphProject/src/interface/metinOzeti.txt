Wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. The messages will be "unwrapped" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.
